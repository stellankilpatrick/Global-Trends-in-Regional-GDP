## Project Overview
This project analyzes the trends in GDP data from different regions in the world. The GDP changes in the 1970s and 2000s of seven regions defined by World Bank were studied. By exploring the differences between the two time periods, trends were exctracted and hypothesis tests were performed to determine if there was a statistically significant level of change. By seperating the globe into its geographical regions, we can better understand where the future of global economy and power is heading towards. 

All code was done in RStudio on an RMD file, then knitted to an HTML file. Tidyverse was used for the transformation and wrangling of the data, and ggplot2 for all graphs and charts. The data was accessed through datahub.io and sourced from the World Bank and OECD; more information is available in the HTML file.
